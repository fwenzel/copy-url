# ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fwenzel/copy-url/master/icon/copy-url-32.png) Copy URL Add-on
by Fred Wenzel ``<code@wenzel.io>``

Copy URL is a Firefox add-on. It is the "little brother" of the [Copy
ShortURL](http://github.com/fwenzel/copy-shorturl/) add-on.

Copy URL adds an option to the right-click menu, allowing you to copy the
current page's URL to the clipboard at the click of a button.
